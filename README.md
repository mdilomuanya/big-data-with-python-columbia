# Big Data With Python Columbia Unversity
This repository contains all of my Jupyter Notebooks from Big Data with Python at Columbia University, where I earned an A in the course. The class was a hands-on, project-based introduction to analyzing and visualizing large datasets using Python, with a strong emphasis on real-world environmental and climate data.

Key Skills and Tools Learned:

- Python Programming: control structures, functions, loops, conditionals, strings, lists, arrays, and object-oriented principles.
- Scientific Libraries: extensive use of NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data cleaning, statistical analysis, and plotting.
- Big Data Handling: organizing and sub-selecting large datasets (e.g., 50,000+ arsenic measurements, global CO₂ time series).
- Statistical Analysis: correlation, regression, hypothesis testing, and fitting models to environmental and socioeconomic data.
- Data Visualization: creating static, multi-layered, and animated plots; colormaps; and comparative visualizations across datasets.
- Spatial & Mapping Skills: working with geographic data, building maps, and integrating netCDF datasets.
- Time Series Analysis: organizing, analyzing, and visualizing climate and environmental time series for trends and anomalies.
- Data Acquisition: downloading, cleaning, and analyzing datasets from the internet.
- Research & Communication: developing hypotheses, independently analyzing datasets, and presenting results in a final project.

This work demonstrates proficiency in data wrangling, statistical computing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization—core skills for any data analyst. The notebooks show how to translate complex datasets into meaningful insights through clear code, structured workflows, and compelling visuals.
